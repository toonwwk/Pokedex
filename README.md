# Pokedex
- uses Alomofire and Codable for mapping JSON
- uses CollectionView for displaying pokemon list
- uses auto layout for displaying on portrait orientation
- uses RxSwift for searching Pokemon name
- uses MVC pattern

# What I've learnt from this 
> The code in controller is quite messy and I've tried to look up MVVM pattern.
> However, when I attemp to create new object for ViewModel, I can't initialized a variable in the decoder section.
> Then I decide to stick with MVC pattern bacause at least it's work and I don't want to do a thing which I'm not really understand. I will look up for the MVVM more and hope I can do it in the futre
